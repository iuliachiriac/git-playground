Ingredients:

- 1 lb chicken breast tenders
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 large eggs
- Vegetable oil, for frying

Instructions:

1. In a shallow bowl, mix together the flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.
2. In another shallow bowl, beat the eggs.
3. Dip each chicken tender into the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.
4. Then dip the chicken into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off.
5. Dip the chicken back into the flour mixture, coating evenly on all sides.
6. Place the coated chicken tenders on a plate or baking sheet.
7. In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
8. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the chicken tenders, a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the skillet.
9. Cook the chicken tenders until golden brown and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes per side.
10. Remove the cooked chicken tenders using tongs or a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
11. Repeat the frying process with the remaining chicken tenders.
12. Serve the chicken tenders hot with your favorite dipping sauce.

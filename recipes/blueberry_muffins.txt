Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease the cups.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

4. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients, alternating with the yogurt. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Avoid overmixing, as it can result in dense muffins.

5. Gently fold in the blueberries, being careful not to break them.

6. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.

7. Bake for about 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The muffin tops should be golden brown.

8. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your homemade blueberry muffins!
